# kangaroo_simulations
progress on our kangaroo hopping simulations

This simulation is based on the ISB-2021: Workshop on optimal control in Biomechanics
found here

https://github.com/antoinefalisse/ISB21-workshop/tree/main

The workshop is based on the walking example from the following paper: "An Introduction to Trajectory Optimization: How to Do Your Own Direct Collocation" by Matthew Kelly (SIAM Review, Vol. 59, No. 4, pp. 849-904).

We will use a model with 4 segments (femurs, tibia, metatarsal, and torso) driven by ankle, knee, and hip torques. 

# Pre-requisites:
Install CasADi, following the instructions (here)[https://web.casadi.org/get/].
